how to store int beforehand
we cannot store int beforehand because it is a looselly typed laanguage
difference between switch and if else, switch case is for exact value comparison and a single expression , if else can have compare values in range
we use switch when we have a single variable with many possible values . Compilers optimize switch statements using jump tables,
or a full switch a compiler will generate a jump table, that is, an array of pointers to labels in which to index directly (provided that the value fits the range).
